Reaper scripts to make virtual soundcheck and live multitrack record sessions faster to setup.

In actions menu make new reascript,paste this in and hit cmd+s to save. Add the action to a toolbar button or keyboard shortcut for quick access or run from actions menu when needed. 

Auto patch sees how many tracks you have and makes each one mono input and mono output to the matching hardware. eg dante DVS standard licence will patch 64 tracks in/out to your DVS.

Just insert mutlitracks in reaper and hit autopatch. It will skip any tracks that don't fit to the hardware in/out count and pop up a confirmation message to show what it has done. So track 1/ Input 1/ Output 1. It also sets sends prefade/premute/prefx and disables record monitoring and master sends.

The teardown script resets all tracks to unassigned inputs and outputs.
